# m001 - MongoDB Basics

## Chapter 1 - what is MongoDB?

- MongoDB is a nosql (meaning it doesn't use tables of data like excel or sql) document database
- A **Document** is a way to store data in field-value pairs (Like a Javascript object)
  - Think of this as a row in excel
  - A **field** would be the column name and a **value** would be the cell value within a column
- A **Collection** is a group of documents
  - Think of this as an excel tab
- A **database** is a group of collections.
  - Think of this as the entire excel file
- MongoDB **Atlas** is a database as a service used for MongoDB
- **Clusters** are groups of servers that host your data
  - **Replica sets** are essentially additional copies of your data (called an instance ). This insures that everything is properly backed up in case of any damage
  - An **instance** is a single machine that stores your data in the cloud
- Atlas Interface - The left navigation pane is cluster management
